Cuando se realiza la autenticación de Windows haciendo uso de TSC en algunas ocasiones vamos a encontrar errores de falla de autenticación.
Mi consejo es realizar lo siguiente a partir de la recomendación de tenable:

[WMI]
1. Log on to another Windows host on the same subnet as the target. Any Windows OS 7+ will work, assuming it's not a Home/Starter edition.
2. Click the start button, then type in "wbemtest" and hit enter. 
3. Click "Connect..." and in the box that comes up, add \\[IP or hostname of the target host]\ before "root\cimv2" 

For example, when the box comes up it will show: 
root\cimv2 

For IP address 10.0.0.1, you would change it to: 

\\10.0.0.1\root\cimv2


4. Under Credentials, enter the username and password of your scanning user. 
5. Click Connect - if any errors come up, take screenshots. 
6. For a successful connection, you should see under Namespace: 

\\[IP address or hostname]\root\cimv2 

7. If you get an error message, you can likely do a search to find information about what it means.

Resolution
[Testing from a Windows Host]

Run all commands from an elevated Command prompt or PowerShell on a host in the same network as the target. Make sure this is not done on the target itself. If possible, use the scanner.
Anonymous IPC$ login test

Test the IPC$ share without a username by using the following command. This command is similar to how Nessus checks the share.
Note: Change <Target_IP> to the target's IP address.

net use \\<Target_IP>\ipc$ "" /user:""

For example:

User-added image
If this returns "Failed to connect to the IPC$ share anonymously." then the following should be verified:

    Ensure SMB is set up correctly
    Double-check firewall settings

SMB Log on Test

This is how Nessus tests the credentials to make sure it has access to the system.

Run the following commands from an elevated command prompt.
Note: Replace <username> and <password> with the credentials the scan is using. Also, change <Target_IP> to the target's IP address.

net use \\<Target_IP>\ipc$ /user:<username> <password>
net use \\<Target_IP>\admin$ /user:<username> <password>

User-added image
These commands should return "The command completed successfully." If it does not, then:

    Check the credentials.
    Check the account has sufficient privileges.

Remote Registry Test
Run the following command to check if the remote registry is running.
Note: Change <Target_IP> to the target's IP address.

reg query \\x.x.x.x\hklm

User-added image
If this returns registry keys, the service is running and accessible.  If this returns "ERROR: The network path was not found." then the service is not running and must be enabled.
Testing from a Linux Host

The program smbclient can be used as an alternative method of testing if the Nessus scanner is running on a Linux system that is scanning the Windows-based host. To install smbclient, run the following command as root:

yum install samba-client

To test the IPC$ share without a username by using the following command. This command is similar to how Nessus checks the share.
Note: Change <Target_IP> to the target's IP address.

smbclient ///x.x.x.x/IPC$ -U Administrator password

    If this returns "smb: \>", then the credentials and permissions work.
    If this returns "session setup failed: NT_STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE", then:
        Check the credentials.
        Check the account has sufficient privileges.
